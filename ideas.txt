The basic workflow idea goes as follows:

We start a website running on localhost, which is necessary for the QR code scanner seen there. 
Then, we start a python script "main", which does the following:
--listens for changes to some folder. When a change detected (new hw scanned and uploaded), the shell script is run
--Then, uploads .png to the website, and uses python to find out username and pw values
--logs into drive, and uploads the file from the drive
--from drive, uploads to google classroom
--logs out the drive
--listens for changes to the folder
